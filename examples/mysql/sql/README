Note: these instructions assume that:
 - the postgresql installation is running on your local machine
 - you are running postgresql >= 9.0
 - you are the postgres user, or postgres is configured to allow your
   current user to login as the postgres user ( via trust or ident ).


To create linkwarz database the first time:

         1) ensure plpgsql language is installed in posgres.
         
            su - postgres
            createlang plpgsql template1
            
         2) Create linkwarz DB
         
            // new, easy method:
            ./create_db.sh

            // old, by hand method:
            psql -U postgres template1
            
            # create database linkwarz with encoding='unicode';
            # \c linkwarz
            # begin;
            # \i everything.sql
            # commit;
            # ^D


To recreate the database.  For example, if schema has changed. ( will wipe all user data )

        ./recreate_db.sh



Various bits/notes for anyone maintaining the database:

The schema.sql is/was/should be generated with this command:

            /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_dump -U postgres -s -c linkwarz > schema.sql


It can be restored (into a freshly created database named linkwarz) via:

            psql -U postgres linkwarz < schema.sql

init_data.sql is trickier to create.  It consists of all the static data that should be present
in the DB, and was created by hand.  handle with care.

The general methodology used during development regarding SQL tables is:

1) full schema and init_data are maintained in this directory.
2) functions and triggers are maintained in their respective sub-directories.

3) ** IMPORTANT ** All changes are made first in these files, then in the database.
   This ensures that CVS is kept up-to-date with the DB changes.
